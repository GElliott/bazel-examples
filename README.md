My collection of [Bazel](http://bazel.io) BUILD examples.

Please first run `./install-deps.sh` to install dependencies if your
are using Debian or Ubuntu, or use the package system you are using.

Then run `./download-srcs.sh` to download source code tarballs.

Note that the BUILD files are very hackish; they might not work on your
machine.
